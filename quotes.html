 Our goal is to create a quality of empathic connection that allows everyone's needs to be met.

 In our culture, most of us have been trained to ignore our own wants and to discount our needs.

 The key to fostering connection in the face of a 'no' is always hearing 'yes' to something else.

 To practice NVC, we must completely abandon the goal of getting other people to do what we want.

 The first step in healing is to put the focus on what's alive now, not what happened in the past.


 Violence comes from the belief that other people cause our pain and therefore deserve punishment.

 #favorite
 Schooling teaches us to dehumanize human beings by thinking of what they are rather than what they need.

 We do not look for compromise; rather, we seek to resolve the conflict to everyone's complete satisfaction.

 Fear of corporal punishment obscures children's awareness of the compassion underlying the parent's demands.

 When our communication supports compassionate giving and receiving, happiness replaces violence and grieving! ~ Marshall B. Rosenberg

 NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.

 #favorite
 When people hear needs, it provokes compassion. When people hear diagnoses, it provokes defensiveness and attack.

 Anger, depression, guilt, and shame are the product of the thinking that is at the base of violence on our planet.

 #favorite

 #favorite
 Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. Hear that they're in pain. Don't hear their analysis.

 [Rob Bednark left off here Mon 11/6/14; read all of the above]

 Social change involves helping people see new options for making life wonderful that are less costly to get needs met.

 118

 The punitive use of force tends to generate hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very behavior we are seeking.

 119

 If we wish to express anger fully, the first step is to divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger.

 119

 Unless we as social change agents come from a certain kind of spirituality, we're likely to create more harm than good.

 120

 Regardless of our many differences, we all have the same needs. What differs is the strategy for fulfilling these needs.

 121

 Keep in mind that other people's actions can never 'make' you feel any certain way. Feelings are your warning indicators.

 121

 NVC suggests behind every action, however ineffective, tragic, violent, or abhorrent to us, is an attempt to meet a need.

 122

 However impressed we may be with NVC concepts, it is only through practice and application that our lives are transformed.

 125

 Postpone result/solution thinking until later; it's through connection that solutions materialize - empathy before education.

 126

 NVC is founded on language and communication skills that strengthen our ability to remain human, even under trying conditions.

 129

 I wouldn't expect someone who's been injured to hear my side until they felt that I had fully understood the depth of their pain.

 130

 When we are depressed, our thinking blocks us from being aware of our needs, and then being able to take action to meet our needs.

 131

 Anger is a signal that you're distracted by judgmental or punitive thinking, and that some precious need of yours is being ignored.

 131

 Often, instead of offering empathy, we have a strong urge to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling.

 133

 When our communication supports compassionate giving and receiving, happiness replaces violence and grieving! ~ Marshall B. Rosenberg

 134

 Whether I praise or criticize someone's action, I imply that I am their judge, that I'm engaged in rating them or what they have done.

 134

 While we may not consider the way we talk to be 'violent,' our words often lead to hurt and pain, whether for others or for ourselves.

 135

 We can't win at somebody else's expense. We can only fully be satisfied when the other person's needs are fulfilled as well as our own.

 139

 The intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury, never to punish or to cause individuals to suffer, repent or change.

 140

 Make your goal to attend to your underlying needs and to aim for a resolution so satisfying that everyone involved has their needs met also.

 140

 Our survival as a species depends on our ability to recognize that our well-being and the well-being of others are in fact one and the same.

  141

  The more we use words that in any way imply criticism, the more difficult it is for people to stay connected to the beauty within themselves.

  142

  Never question the beauty of what you are saying because someone reacts with pain, judgment, criticism. It just means they have not heard you.

  145

  Use the words "I feel because I" to remind us that what we feel it isn't because of what the other person did, but because of a choice I've made.

  148

  NVC shows us a way of being very honest, but without any criticism, insults, or putdowns, and without any intellectual diagnosis implying wrongness.

  150

  Once you have access to key people in an organization, if you go into a meeting with enemy images of those people - then you are not going to connect.

  150

  We recognize that real educational reform is essential if today's and tomorrow's children are to live in a more peaceful, just, and sustainable world.

  152

  I believe that the most joyful and intrinsic motivation human beings have for taking any action is the desire to meet our needs and the needs of others.

  153

  My need is for safety, fun and to have distribution of resources, a sustainable life on the planet. NVC is a strategy that serves me to meet these needs.

  155

  My ultimate goal is to spend as many of my moments in life as I can in that world that the poet Rumi talks about, 'a place beyond rightness and wrongness.'

  156

  Four D's of Disconnection: 1. Diagnosis (judgment, analysis, criticism, comparison); 2. Denial of Responsibility; 3. Demand; 4. 'Deserve' oriented language.

  156

  Time and again, people transcend the paralyzing effects of psychological pain when they have sufficient contact with someone who can hear them empathically.

  158

  Praise and reward create a system of extrinsic motivations for behavior. Children (and adults) end up taking action in order to receive the praise or rewards.

  158

  Two things distinguish nonviolent actions from violent actions. First, you don't see an enemy and second, your intention is not to make the other side suffer.

  159

  If the other persons behavior is not in harmony with my own needs, the more I empathize with them and their needs, the more likely I am to get me own needs met

  161

  Violence results when people trick themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.

  162

  I think that there is a problem with rewards and consequences because in the long run, they rarely work in the ways we hope. In fact, they are likely to backfire.

  165

  When we sense ourselves being defensive or unable to empathize, we need to (a) stop, breathe, give ourselves empathy, (b) express nonviolently, or (c) take time out.

  168

  Once you can clearly describe what you are reacting to, free of your interpretation or evaluation of it, other people are less likely to be defensive when they hear it.

  170

  When we make mistakes, we can use the process of NVC mourning and self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow instead of getting caught up in moralistic self-judgments.

  172

  NVC is interested in learning that is motivated by reverence for life, by a desire to learn skills, to contribute better to our own well-being and the well-being of others.

  176

  The best way I can get understanding from another person is to give this person the understanding, too. If I want them to hear my needs and feelings, I first need to empathize.

  184

  Power-Over leads to punishment and violence. Power-With leads to compassion and understanding, and to learning motivated by reverence for life rather than fear, guilt, shame, or anger.

  185

  The key to fostering connection in the face of a 'no' is always 'yes' to something else and, as such, it is the beginning, not the end of a conversation. Hear the 'Yes' behind the 'No'.

  186

  Nonviolent Communication shows us a way of being very honest, but without any criticism, without any insults, without any putdowns, without any intellectual diagnosis implying wrongness.

  194

  If we ask two questions, we will see that punishment never works. First: What do we want the other person to do? Second: What do we want the other person's reasons to be for doing as we request?

  195

  Labeling and diagnosis is a catastrophic way to communicate. Telling other people what's wrong with them greatly reduces, almost to zero, the probability that we're going to get what we're after.

  195

  To practice NVC, it's critical for me to be able to slow down, take my time, to come from an energy I choose, the one I believe that we were meant to come from, not the one I was programmed into.

  200

  Clinical training in psychoanalysis has a deficit. It teaches how to sit and think about what a person is saying and how to interpret it intellectually, but not how to be fully present to this person.

  200

  The number one reason that we don't get our needs met, we don't express them. We express judgments. If we do express needs, the number two reasons we don't our needs met, we don't make clear requests.

  201

  Before we tackle the gangs and the basic story, we have to make sure that we have liberated ourselves from how we have been educated and make sure we are coming from a spirituality of our own choosing.

  209

  Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments however positive, and are sometimes offered to manipulate the behavior of others. NVC encourages the expression of appreciation solely for celebration.

  218

  NVC enhances inner communication by helping us translate negative internal messages into feelings and needs. Our ability to distinguish our own feelings and needs and to empathize with them can free us from depression.

  235

  Children need far more than basic skills in reading, writing, and math, as important as those might be. Children also need to learn how to think for themselves, how to find meaning in what they learn, and how to work and live together.

  243

  Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse potential violence, help us hear the word 'no' without taking it as a rejection, revive lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence.

  248

  Life-Enriching Education: an education that prepares children to learn throughout their lives, relate well to others, and themselves, be creative, flexible, and venturesome, and have empathy not only for their immediate kin but for all of humankind

  253

  To practice NVC, it's critical for me to be able to slow down, take my time, to come from an energy I choose, the one I believe that we were meant to come from, not the one I was programmed into. I start the day with a remembering of where I want to be.

  255

  Teacher, school administrators and parents will come away from Life-Enriching Education with skills in language, communication, and ways of structuring the learning environment that support the development of autonomy and interdependence in the classroom.

  263

  NVC can be effectively applied at all levels of communication and in diverse situations: intimate relationships, families, schools, organizations and institutions, therapy and counseling, diplomatic and business negotiations, disputes and conflicts of any nature.

  276

  There are the two main reasons we don't get our needs met. First, we don't know how to express our needs to begin with and second if we do, we forget to put a clear request after it, or we use vague words like appreciate, listen, recognize, know, be real, and stuff like that.

  277

  As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism. We come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized.

  280

  Some people use NVC to respond compassionately to themselves, some to create greater depth in their personal relationships, and still others to build effective relationships at work or in the political arena. Worldwide, NVC is used to mediate disputes and conflicts at all levels.

  286

  Every moment each human being is doing the best we know at that moment to meet our needs. We never do anything that is not in the service of a need, there is no conflict on our planet at the level of needs. We all have the same needs. The problem is in strategies for meeting the needs.

  286

  There are two things that distinguish truly nonviolent actions from violent actions. First, there is no enemy in the nonviolent point of view. You don't see an enemy. Your thinking is clearly focused on protecting your needs. Second, your intention is not to make the other side suffer.

  336

  When we express our needs indirectly through the use of evaluations, interpretations, and images, others are likely to hear criticism. When people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack. It's important that when we address somebody that we're clear what we want back.

  373

  If I'm using Nonviolent Communication I never, never, never hear what somebody thinks about me. Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. You'll enjoy life more. Hear the truth. The truth is that when somebody's telling you what's wrong with you, the truth is they have a need that isn't getting met. Hear that they're in pain. Don't hear the analysis.

  383

  Public education for some time has been heavily focused on what curricula we believe will be helpful to students. Life-Enriching Education is based on the premise that the relationship between teachers and students, the relationships of students with one another, and the relationships of students to what they are learning are equally important in preparing students for the future.

  482

  Conflicts, even of long standing duration, can be resolved if we can just keep the flow of communication going in which people come out of their heads and stop criticizing and analyzing each other, and instead get in touch with their needs, and hear the needs of others, and realize the interdependence that we all have in relation to each other. We can't win at somebody else's expense. We can only fully be satisfied when the other person's needs are fulfilled as well as our own.

  517

  Peace requires something far more difficult than revenge or merely turning the other cheek; it requires empathizing with the fears and unmet needs that provide the impetus for people to attack each other. Being aware of those feelings and needs, people lose their desires to attack back because they see the human ignorance leading to those attacks. Instead, their goal becomes providing the empathic connection and education that will enable them to transcend their violence and engage in cooperative relationships.'

  674

  I would like to suggest that when our heads are filled with judgments and analyses that others are bad, greedy, irresponsible, lying, cheating, polluting the environment, valuing profit more than life, or behaving in other ways they shouldn't, very few of them will be interested in our needs. If we want to protect the environment, and we go to a corporate executive with the attitude, "You know, you are really a killer of the planet, you have no right to abuse the land in this way," we have severely impaired our chances of getting our needs met. It is a rare human being who can maintain focus on our needs when we are expressing them through images of their wrongness.

  865

  I would like us to create peace at three levels and have each of us to know how to do it. First, within ourselves. That is to know how we can be peaceful with ourselves when we're less than perfect, for example. How we can learn from our limitations without blaming and punishing our self. If we can't do that, I'm not too optimistic how we're going to relate peacefully out in the world. Second, between people. Nonviolent Communication training shows people how to create peace within themselves and at the same time how to create connections with other people that allows compassionate giving to take place naturally. And third, in our social systems. To look out at the structures that we've created, the governmental structures and other structures, and to look at whether they support peaceful connections between us and if not, to transform those structures.

If you look to others for fulfillment, you will never truly be fulfilled.  If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself.  Be content with what you have.  Rejoice in the way things are.  When you realize there is nothing lacking the whole world belongs to you.

We get so hung up on like and dislike, on who’s right and who’s wrong, as if these labels were ultimately real. Yet the human experience is an experience of nothing to hang on to, nothing that’s set once and for all. Reality is always falling apart.<br/>
In this fleeting situation, the only thing that makes sense is for us to reach out to one another.

There is no controlling life.<br/>
Try corralling a lightning bolt, containing a tornado.<br/>
Dam a stream and it will create a new channel.<br/>
Resist, and the tide will sweep you off your feet.<br/>
Allow, and grace will carry you to higher ground.<br/>
The only safety lies in letting it all in –<br/>
the wild and the weak;<br/>
fear, fantasies, failures and success.<br/>
When loss rips off the doors of the heart,<br/>
or sadness veils your vision with despair,<br/>
practice becomes simply bearing the truth.<br/>
In the choice to let go of your known way of being,<br/>
the whole world is revealed to your new eyes.

When we are in love with love rather than with an object, in love with the process of love rather than the content, we can feel that we are always in love, a love without conditions. How can we practice that? We can practice turning our attention away from the conversation in the head aimed at reducing the unconditional to conditional, be with the breath of being, and recognize that as love.

Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery it is. In the boredom and pain of it, not less than in the excitement and gladness; touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it, because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.

You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters?

She's not perfect - you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. 
<p>
She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break - her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.

People like the robber barons assumed that the doctrine of the survival of the fittest authenticated them as deserving power. You know, "I'm the richest. Therefore, I'm the best.

You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for;
you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate;
you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for.
You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did.
Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea.

And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating  on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and  money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and  frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has  harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth  and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our  tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation.
<p>
This  kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of course there are all  different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will  not hear much talk about much in the great outside world of wanting and  achieving.... The really important kind of freedom involves attention  and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other  people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy  ways every day.
That is real freedom. That is being educated, and understanding how  to think. 
The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the  rat race, the constant gnawing sense of having had, and lost, some  infinite thing.

I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or  grandly inspirational the way a commencement speech is supposed to  sound.

But please don't just dismiss it as  just some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this stuff is really  about morality or religion or dogma or big fancy questions of life after  death.

Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which 
kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have 
occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed 
would have come his way.  <br>
Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.

Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue... as the 
unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a course greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.  
Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. ...success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to 
think of it."

People who are suffering don't need advice, diagnoses, interpretations and interventions. They need sincere and complete empathy-attention. Once they have the feeling 
that the other person is putting themselves in their shoes, they are able to let go of their suffering and head down the path of healing. 
Attention--being completely available--may well be the most coveted gift. We silently hope that someone will want to do that for us. Pure attention is given without 
judgement and without advice. Attention is a type of friendliness and the lack thereof is the worst kind of rudeness. Attention is the means that allows us to let 
friendliness flow. Anyone who can't give others attention, will never be friendly. Attention gives energy, while the lack of attention takes it away.

I think the most important question facing humanity is, "Is the universe a friendly place?" This is the first and most basic question all people must answer for themselves.
<br>
For if we decide that the universe is an unfriendly place, then we will use our technology, our scientific discoveries and our natural resources to achieve safety and power by 
creating bigger walls to keep out the unfriendliness and bigger weapons to destroy all that which is unfriendly--and I believe that we are getting to a place where technology is
powerful enough that we may either completely isolate or destroy ourselves as well in this process.
<br>
If we decide that the universe is neither friendly nor unfriendly and that God is essentially playing dice with the universe, then we are simply victims to the random toss of 
the dice and our lives have no real purpose or meaning.
<br>
But if we decide that the universe is a friendly place, then we will use our technology, our scientific discoveries and our natural resources to create tools and models for 
understanding that universe. Because power and safety will come through understanding its workings and its motives.

A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe... a part limited in time and space. He experiences his thoughts and feelings as separated from the rest--a kind of 
optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task 
must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

We would like you to release the word "achieve" or "earn" from your vocabulary and from your understanding, altogether, and we would like you to replace those words 
with the word "allow". You're wanting to allow your Well-being, not achieve it. It's not something that you need to earn. All you have to do is decide what it is 
you would like to experience, and then allow it in order to achieve it. It isn't something you have to struggle for or try for. You are all worthy beings. You are 
deserving of this Well-being.

Humans and their deeds are two distinct things.  It is quite proper to resist and attack a system, but to resist and attack its author is tantamount to resisting and attacking oneself.  For we are all tarred with the
same brush and are children of one and the same Creator, and as such the divine powers within us are infinite.  To slight a single human being is to slight those divine powers and thus to harm not only that being
but with them the entire world.

Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, brilliant and fabulous. Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God... you are... and your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
We were born to make manifest the glory of God within us. It is not just in some of us, it is in every one of us. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. 
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

What are we here for and what is it that we should be doing?  A person, let's say, is just a mother all their life until they die.  Is that a calling?  Yes, that IS a calling.  You may not be an impact in society, but your
children may be.  Even though you are not fruitful in the eyes of society, you are fruitful in the big picture.  But "I" says it's not enough.  If that is the calling, do the best at what is presented to you.
If I am a chef and that is all I do for my whole life, that is enough.  Calling is not what I want; it's what is presented to me.  We cannot compare ourselves with others.  We cannot compare callings.  You are given
certain things in life as you go along in life. The roles in your callings change as you progress.  Sure, we want to make a difference.  But don't force something to happen when it's not happening.  Accept what is presented
to you.  Sometimes it's not what we want that's important, it's what presents itself to us that's important.  It's strange, but humans don't see being human as a career!  To live life the best way we can and to give all the

Go back to any time in your life when you reached your outcome.  You probably knew what the obstacles were and you planned to overcome them.  So you focused on your goal and when you
were nearing a potential delay or "pothole," you saw it, navigated around it and moved on without commotion.  You've no doubt done this thousands of times.
One of the keys to being successful at a skill set and enjoying the process of accomplishment in it is being able to get to the point where you can become unconsciously aware, without effort, of the 
obstacles to success and happily move around them without concern and without apparent effort.  That takes practice.  So practice!

A comical thing is that most people focus only on the obstacles.  They never get where they want to be because after they get started, hurdles appear.  And suddenly the entire focus becomes the hurdles.  The goal
gets fuzzier and harder to see.  "What are we doing this for?" is a common thought.
A main reason most people don't get where they originally steer their ship is that they have no clue where the rocks are... and once they see those rocks, they throw their compass away. 
They get so focused on the obstacles and turned around that it often is impossible to reach their original objective.

Q: Do you think that religious phenomena, like the virgin birth, are symbolic or literal?<BR>
A: Symbolic. [Just as] science can access the very small and the unimaginably large with their special language, which is mathematics and equations, we in religion need a technical language to describe sacred things. 
   And this [language] is myth, poetry, parable. Jesus spoke to them in parables. And so everything that transpires in that infinite world of the divine must be expressed metaphorically, not literally.<BR>
Q: So when we talk of the virgin birth, it resonates with something in us about purity, about divinity.<BR>
A: No, no, don't try to say it. In ordinary language it won't work. Something happened. Something happened. And I sincerely believe it really happened. And it was really vital, crucial to Christ. But don't try to psych 
   it out in ordinary language. Go at it in terms of symbols, which stretch our understanding from the finite to the infinite.

Most people just aren't self-disciplined enough to take a bit, study it, master it then move on to the next level.  That's why universities are so valuable and 
so expensive...  they do it right.

They give you a little bit, test you and then give you some more -- building on your knowledge after you've learned the easier stuff.

Mahatma Gandhi was once leading a large protest across India.  A few days into the march,
he found out that there was going to be a great deal of violence, and he abruptly
announced that he was ending the march.  Some of his followers and supporters said,
"But Gandhiji, you can't call off this march.  Many people, from all over India, left
their jobs and came great distances to be on this march."  Gandhi replied, "Only God
knows absolute truth.  I just know relative truth.  My allegiance must be to truth,
not consistency."

I don't want to justify religion in terms of its benefits to us. I believe that, on balance, it does a lot of bad things, too -- a tremendous amount.
But I don't think that the final justification of religion is the good it does for people. I think the final justification is that it's true, and
truth takes priority over consequences. Religion helps us deal with what is most important to the human spirit: values, meaning, purpose, and quality.

We regard disappointment, embarassment, irritation, jealousy, and fear as momements that show us when we're holding back,
how we're shutting down.  Such uncomfortable feelings are messages that tell us to perk up and lean into a situation when

Television's perfect. You turn a few knobs, a few of those mechanical adjustments at which the higher apes are so proficient, and lean back and
drain your mind of all thought. And there you are watching the bubbles in the primeval ooze. You don't have to concentrate. You don't have to react.
You don't have to remember. You don't miss your brain because you don't need it. Your heart and liver and lungs continue to function normally.
Apart from that, all is peace and quiet. You are in the man's nirvana. And if some poor nasty minded person comes along and says you look like a fly
on a can of garbage, pay him no mind. He probably hasn't got the price of a television set.

Once one of my students told me about acting. <BR>
"The secret is that you cannot use a negative motivation," he said.  "You cannot portray 'not wanting to stay,' only 'wanting to leave.'  You cannot be a person 
who 'does not want to be alone,' only a person who is 'eager to be with others.'" <BR>
"Why are you telling me this?" <BR>
"Because this knowledge has changed my life."<BR>
"I am not following you."<BR>
"Acting starts with just that.  Action.  It starts with a simple act portraying a simple positive intention.  One intention, one action, then another, and another, 
and gradually you are asserting your vision.  Your audience--the people who are around you--can recognize and respond to something solid and authentic... It's a 
gradual process, of course, but the point simply is to make an inital act toward what you want to become.  Stop ruminating and reconsider your life in terms of 
actions you can take...  It helps to tame the helplessness."

When we bathe in the river today that we bathed in yesterday, is it the same river?  The water in the river today is completely different from the water we bathed in 
yesterday. Yet it is the same river.<BR>
--<BR>
The insight of impermanence helps us to go beyond all concepts. It helps us to go beyond same and different, coming and going. It helps us to see that the river is 
not the same river but is also not different either. It shows us that the flame we lit on our bedside candle before we went to bed is not the same flame of the next 
morning. The flame on the table is not two flames, but it is not one flame either. <BR>
--<BR>
We are often sad and suffer a lot when things change, but change and impermanence have a positive side. Thanks to impermanence, everything is possible. Life itself is possible... If your daughter is not impermanent, she cannot grow up to become a woman. Then your grandchildren would never manifest. So instead of complaining about 
impermanence, we should say, "Warm welcome and long live impermanence." We should be happy. When we can see the miracle of impermanence our sadness and suffering will pass.

Light energy enters our being through our eyes, but our vision of reality is determined more by what we see with our mind's eye than what we see with our physical eye.  In fact, I found that our eyesight is simply a 
reflection of our view of reality.  So when the mind begins to see more clearly, the eyes also begin to see more clearly...

In a world where time cannot be measured, there are no clocks, no calendars, no definite appointments.  Events are triggered by other events, not by time.  A house is begun when stone
and lumber arrive at the building site.  The stone quarry delivers stone when the quarryman needs money....   Trains leave the station...when the cars are filled with passengers...  Long
ago, before the Great Clock, time was measured by changes in heavenly bodies: the slow sweep of stars across the night sky, the arc of the sun and the variation in light, the waxing and
waning of the moon, tides, seasons.  Time was measured also by heartbeats, the rhythms of drowsiness and sleep, the recurrence of hunger, the menstrual cycles of women, the duration of loneliness.

My earliest memory is of water.  I was submerged in it.  I had stepped off a dock into Clark Lake.  Before my Aunt Rui jumped in after me I had time to hit 
bottom -- the lake was about three feet deep -- and look around.  A bubble formed around my head and I could breathe in it.  I was two and a half.  I 
learned this much: adults could not breathe underwater, but a child could do anything.  About four years later, I held a paper bag above my head and jumped 
off a roof.  Instantaneously, I reached full speed and slammed into the ground.  I learned this much: adulthood begins at six.

Fears<BR>
  Fear is the perception of possible loss.  We have not lost anything yet, from life to a bought object or keys.  But we are afraid of losing something and so
  often inhibit ourselves from risking living a new life.  The unconscious reaction to fear is to contract.  Contraction freezes us and severely limits 
  our ability to interact with what is seeking to harm or destroy us or our things.  Better to tremble and shake in the face of adversity, for at least 
  that releases energy which may be the preparation for activity and movement.  Still better would be centered coping with what is difficult in the moment, 
  doing this without fear but with a lively consciousness.  Fear is being afraid of that which does not yet exist.  If we are fully in each moment we 
  will not be afraid and will act without fear.  Whatever happens will be a success because we have fully given ourselves to the moment that is.  A good 
  preparation for being this centered is to practice letting go of anything to which we become attached.  Attachment is what limits us.  If we are 
  identified with something or someone, and therefore afraid of experiencing a loss, we will limit ourselves.  You must act as if the deep relationship you 
  have, the object you have bought or created, the life you live, will be gone tomorrow, if not sooner.  For in fact what happens tomorrow is going to be 
  new and not a repetition of today.  Let even the good stuff go, as you live vitally and without fear.  Voluntary sacrifice is the only true insurance 
  there is.

Once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river. 

<BR>
The current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and old, rich and poor, good and evil, the current going its own way,
knowing only its own crystal self. 

<BR>
Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, and
resisting the current what each had learned from birth. 

<BR>
But one creature said at last, 'I am tired of clinging. Though I cannot see it with my eyes, I trust that the current knows where it is
going. I shall let go, and let it take me where it will. Clinging, I shall die of boredom.' 

<BR>
The other creatures laughed and said, 'Fool! Let go, and that current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed across the
rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom!' 

<BR>
But the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go, and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks. 

<BR>
Yet in time, as the creature refused to cling again, the current lifted him free from the bottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more.

<BR>
And the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried, 'See a miracle! A creature like ourselves, yet he flies! See the Messiah, come to save us all!' 

<BR>
And the one carried in the current said, 'I am no more Messiah than you. The river delights to lift us free, if only we dare let go. Our true 
work is this voyage, this adventure.' 

<BR>
But they cried the more, 'Saviour!' all the while clinging to the rocks, and when they looked again he was gone, and they were left alone making legends of a Saviour.

Should reality be something that only a handful of the world's most advanced physicists understand?  One would expect at least a majority of people to 
understand it.  Should reality be expressible only in symbols that require university-level mathematics to manipulate?  Should it be something that changes 
from year to year as new scientific theories are formulated?  Should it be something about which different schools of physics can quarrel for years with no 
firm resolution on either side?  If this is so then how is it fair to imprison a person in a mental hospital for life with no trial and no jury and no

The realization of your bliss, your true being, comes when you have put aside what might be called the "passing moment" with its terror and with its
temptations and its statement of requirements of life that you should live this way....I always tell my students to follow their bliss--where the deep
sense of being is from, and where your body and soul want to go.  When you have that feeling, then stay with it, and don't let anyone throw you off.  I
say don't be afraid to follow your bliss and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.

Philadelphia comes in and burns the house down.  I go down to Dallas.  I get a job as a 'before' in a Charles Atlas 'before-and-after' ad.  I move in with

delivery boy--he ain't so mild.  He gives her the knife, and the next thing I know I'm in Omaha (Neb.).  It's so cold there, but this time I'm robbing my
own bicycles and frying my own fish.  I stumble onto some luck and get a job as a carburetor out at the hot-rod races every Thursday night.  I move in
with a high-school teacher who also does a little plumbing on the side, who ain't much to look at but who's built a special kind of refrigerator that can
turn newspaper into lettuce.  Everything's going good until that delivery boy shows up and tries to knife me.  Needless to say, he burned the house down,

--but it is always living, moving, and your mind is like that.  It is in the flowing river there are so many things--fishes, leaves, dead animals 
everlastingly restless, flitting from one thing to another like a butterfly--just watch your mind.  It is great fun.  If you try it as fun, as an amusing 
thing, you will find that the mind begins to settle down without any effort on your part to control it.

My life in writing, or my life as a writer, comes to me as two parts, like two rivers that blend.  One part is easy to tell: the times, the events, the places, 
the people.  The other part is mysterious; it is my thoughts, the flow of my inner life, the reveries and impluses that never get known--perhaps even to me.

Perhaps [we] would do well to lose the plan, throw away the map, get off the motorcycle, put on a very strange-looking hat, bark sharply
three times, and trot off looking thin, yellow, and dingy across the desert and up into the digger pines...  We're in a rational dilemma, an
either/or situation as perceived by the binary computer mentality, and neither the either nor the or is a place where people can live...  I am
offered the Grand Inquisitor's choice.  Will you choose freedom without happiness, or happiness without freedom?  The only answer one can make,
I think, is: No.

Each day, the Victim in you will become weaker and the Victor will become stronger.  Each day, you will feel a deeper connection to life, a life you feel 
in charge of rather than a life that has taken charge of you.  This is the way you were meant to live because it makes you want to live -- empowerment 
makes you feel that you can create anything.  And then one day you notice that you are not conscious of the Victim any longer.  You have the strength to 
face anything that you need to face, whether it's the creation of a new life or the release of a life lived fully to the end.

This temptation of the mind to reduce every wonder, every mystery, to a question, is basically fear-oriented. We are afraid, afraid of the tremendousness 
of life, of this incredible existence. We are afraid.  Out of fear we create some small knowledge around ourselves as a protection, as an armor, as a defense. 
It is only cowards who reduce the tremendously valuable capacity of wondering to questions. The really brave, the courageous person, leaves it as it is.

Percolating through the noonday sun<BR>
With wings upon my shoes<BR>
I was jumping about in front of everyone<BR>
No dignity to lose<BR>
There was a rush of animation bubbling about inside my soul<BR>

Like a pig with a bucket full of truffles in a French cafe<BR>
Like Louis Armstrong playing trumpet on the judgement day<BR>
Like a flying boat captain with an amethyst lake below<BR>
Like a winner of a marathon rolling in a field of snow<BR>
