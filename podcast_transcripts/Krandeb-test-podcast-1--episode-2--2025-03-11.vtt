Podcast.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.720
I'm your host Crandeb, and today is Tuesday,

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.560
March 11th, 2025.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.760
And here's a passage from Connecticut Yankee in

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.219
King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.

7
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.600
A word of explanation.

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.440
It was in Warwick Castle that I came

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.020
across the curious stranger who I am going

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.760
to talk about.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.500
He attracted me by three things, his candid

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.580
simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and

13
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.520
the restfulness of his company, for he did

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.240
all the talking.

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.300
We fell together, as modest people will, in

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.920
the tale of the herd that was being

17
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.720
shown through, and he at once began to

18
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.480
say things which interested me.

19
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.980
As he talked along, softly, pleasantly, flowingly, he

20
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.960
seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this

21
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
world and time, and into some remote era

22
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720
and old forgotten country.

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260
And so he gradually wove such a spell

24
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.440
about me that I seemed to move among

25
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.480
the specters and shadows and dust and mold

26
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.100
of a gray antiquity, holding speech with a

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.780
relic of it.

28
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.280
Exactly as I would speak of my nearest

29
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.640
personal friends or enemies, or my most familiar

30
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.180
neighbors, he spoke of Sir Belvedere, Sir Bordeganus,

31
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.080
Sir Lancelot of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and

32
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.860
all the other great names of the table

33
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.480
round, and how old, old, unspeakably old, and

34
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.560
faded, and dry, and musty, and ancient, he

35
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140
came to look as he went on.

36
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.620
Presently he turned to me and said, just

37
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.640
as one might speak of the weather, or

38
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.160
any other common matter, you know about transmigration

39
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.260
of souls, do you know about transposition of

40
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.540
epochs and bodies?

41
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.160
I said I had not heard of it.

42
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.600
He was so little interested, just as when

43
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.080
people speak of the weather, that he did

44
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.360
not notice whether I made him any answer

45
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.960
or not.

46
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.419
There was half a moment of silence, immediately

47
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.420
interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried

48
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.280
Cicerone.

49
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.560
Ancient Halberk, date of the 6th century, time

50
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.960
of King Arthur and the Round Table, said

51
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.060
to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagrimore

52
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.980
Le Desiris.

53
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.940
Observe the round hole through the chain mail

54
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.020
in the left breast.

55
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.620
Can't be accounted for, supposed to have been

56
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.980
done with a bullet since invention of firearms,

57
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.460
perhaps maliciously by Cromwell's soldiers.

58
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.800
My acquaintance smiled, not a modern smile, but

59
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.200
one that must have gone out of general

60
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.080
use many, many centuries ago, and muttered apparently

61
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.460
to himself, wit ye well, I saw it

62
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.780
done.

63
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.780
Then, after a pause, added, I did it

64
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.280
myself.

65
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.280
By the time I had recovered from the

66
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.480
electric surprise of his remark, he was gone.

67
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.240
All that evening, I sat by my fire

68
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.200
at the Warwick Arms, steeped in a dream

69
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.120
of the olden time, while the rain beat

70
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.720
upon the windows, and the wind roared about

71
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.000
the eaves and corners.

72
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.300
From time to time I dipped into old

73
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.180
Sir Thomas Mallory's enchanting book, and fed at

74
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.280
its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed

75
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.380
in the fragrance of its obsolete names, and

76
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.140
dreamed again.

77
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.640
Midnight, being come at length, I read another

78
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.460
tale for a nightcap, this which here follows

79
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.980
to wit.

80
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.380
That's a passage from A Connecticut Yankee in

81
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.940
King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.

82
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.160
Thank you, and we hope to see you

83
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.420
again.
